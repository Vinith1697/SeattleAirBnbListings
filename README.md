# SeattleAirBnbListings
Tableau Project on AirBnB listings in Seattle
Downloaded the dataset from http://insideairbnb.com.
Cleaned and merged the files to build a proper dataset. 
Imported the dataset into Tableau and joined the tables and created various insights stating the changes in prices of the airbnb listing in Seattle based on the number of bedrooms and time of the year.
